# How To Use

### Windows
You will need windows with the latest .NET v6.0 framework to run this client
1. [Get .NET Framework Here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
2. Download the latest client from [Releases](https://github.com/vertyco/arkview/releases)
3. Run the .exe anywhere you want, it will make a `config.ini` file that you can set your map and cluster path in
4. Set the port you want the client to listen on and forward it in your router
5. Add that port to the server you have it on with the bot via `[p]avset addport <cluster> <server> <port>`
   1. If you have the client running a different computer from the map, you can use `[p]avset addpi` to add a separate ip for the client
